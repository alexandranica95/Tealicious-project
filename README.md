# Tealicious-project
I've developed a front-end application tailored for a bubble tea shop, starting from scratch. This application has a landing page that immediately engages visitors with the shop's offerings. 

Project hosted using Google Firebase: https://tealicious-project.web.app/home/home.html
# Description
As my first project I chose to use HTML, CSS, SCSS and Javascript.
On the landing page the user can access the products catalog from the menu on the top of the page, complete with filtering options to easily find desired flavors or types of bubble tea.

On the products page the user also find a filter with all the products categories.

The shopping experience is intuitive: features such as the ability to add items to the cart with a simple click.
